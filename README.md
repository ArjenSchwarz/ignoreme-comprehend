# ignoreme-comprehend

This repo contains the raw data as well as the output from putting ig.nore.me's weekly notes through the AWS Comprehend service.

In addition there are several scripts for:

* Transforming a directory of Markdown files to plain text using pandoc.
* Running a directory of plain text files through 3 Comprehend APIs.
* Calculating number of occurrences and percentages of the results of the above scripts.

Feel free to play around with.

Article explaining the background can be found on [ig.nore.me](https://ig.nore.me/2018/02/comprehend-ing-my-weekly-notes/)
